# Thoughts on Originality.


This track is based on a dude I met once on the west side of Wendover
Avenue, when I stayed a month or two living in and around this hotel
off of the big curve near Kabuto.  

```
IDK much about his story, but he was out on the streets, just like me.
```

I was wanting to play my synthesizer, but this dude popped up asking
about my kit so I distracted him by playing some beat instrumentals
and playing some bass-tones to the riddim and he actually started
opening up on some hot vocals.  

This soft-packed album includes the original unedited audio recorded
straight off of my `motorola / android smartphone` out in the field,
as well as what I've done with it for use in my live productions.
